### Embed Logos on a Graph


``` r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1, 2, 3))
fig <- fig %>% add_lines() 
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    images = list(
      list(source = "https://images.plot.ly/language-icons/api-home/python-logo.png",
           xref = "paper",
           yref = "paper",
           x= 0,
           y= 1,
           sizex = 0.2,
           sizey = 0.2,
           opacity = 0.8
      ),

      list(source = "https://images.plot.ly/language-icons/api-home/matlab-logo.png",
           xref = "x",
           yref = "paper",
           x = 2.7,
           y = 0.25,
           sizex = 0.4,
           sizey = 0.8,
           opacity = 0.8
      ),

      list(source =  "https://images.plot.ly/language-icons/api-home/r-logo.png",
           xref = "x",

           layer = "below"
      )

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


``` r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
